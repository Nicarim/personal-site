      <description>When I was writing a tutorial regarding usage of VirtualBox to compile Marlin firmware (for 3D Printers) I came across following issue:
E: Failed to fetch store:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/jp.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_focal_main_binary-amd64_Packages.xz Hash Sum mismatch Hashes of expected file: - Filesize:5826751 [weak] - SHA256:af226b4496cbb524bd4814d102047ae77769836203274dffc91cb543d5da13cc - SHA1:aef5c36ce45bd5c3154a1bb03c62b6cfb33e2bc6 [weak] - MD5Sum:7ef83228ec207df10acac48fbdd81112 [weak] Hashes of received file: - SHA256:e2c7fc5a2d86f75f03612fec614dcf84d3d502976558fbe40928c1dd120bb05e - SHA1:aef5c36ce45bd5c3154a1bb03c62b6cfb33e2bc6 [weak] - MD5Sum:7ef83228ec207df10acac48fbdd81112 [weak] - Filesize:5826751 [weak] Last modification reported: Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:40:26 +0000 Release file created at: Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:33:17 +0000 This error was really strange because SHA256 is the only one that differs.</description>

      <title>Docker swarm cluster on single laptop home lab running Proxmox VE</title>

      <description>This is my first blog post about running anything related to home lab. As I have already done some work before to have Proxmox VE running with connection to the router — I will be explaining that in later posts if I find time or motivation to do so.
Planned:  I want to have 3 nodes of VM, with Ubuntu Server running on them, referring to them as Swarm Nodes.</description>

      <description>There are things that I enjoy when working as a professional. One of them is that when the tooling is so good that it just makes want to write the code. Example of state-of-the-art integration of IDE into a language is what Hashicorp has done to the Terraform and its integration with IntelliJ IDEA.
An example of that you can find below
 Autocomplete works out of the box, no configuration needed   One might say &amp;ldquo;yeah, its just a simple gimmick, it will fall apart for more complex things!</description>

      <title>Infra as a Code Is Cloud Lock-In</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of using IaaC tooling in all of my DevOps jobs. It&amp;rsquo;s a great pleasure to be able to define your infrastructure in a code and exactly know what do you have in your cloud. It helps you avoid the situation where you have to ask people in the company to know where something lives. You can simply CTRL+F through the project (assuming you store it in a single repo) and you always know where something is.</description>

      <description>Intro For unfamiliar with Polish economy For the context of this post - I currently live by renting a flat in Warsaw, almost by the city border (Far end of Ursynów district). See the attached view for having a context
 Here is how it looks like   I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty close connection to metro line (which to say is impressive here as Warsaw has only two metro lines).

      <description>After spending a couple of days laying in my bed with absolute no motivation at all to do anything I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do anything that will bring me from the lair of despair.
COVID situation here in Poland at the moment of writing the post is not really great, there is absolutely nothing to do outside because everything is cancelled.
I can either tinker in my &amp;ldquo;electronic workshop&amp;rdquo; or do programming which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really keep motivation for.</description>

      <description>When I was writing a tutorial regarding usage of VirtualBox to compile Marlin firmware (for 3D Printers) I came across following issue:

      <title>Docker swarm cluster on single laptop home lab running Proxmox VE</title>

      <description>This is my first blog post about running anything related to home lab. As I have already done some work before to have Proxmox VE running with connection to the router — I will be explaining that in later posts if I find time or motivation to do so.
Planned:  I want to have 3 nodes of VM, with Ubuntu Server running on them, referring to them as Swarm Nodes.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog post about running anything related to home lab. As I have already done some work before to have Proxmox VE running with connection to the router â€” I will be explaining that in later posts if I find time or motivation to do so.
Planned:  I want to have 3 nodes of VM, with Ubuntu Server running on them, referring to them as Swarm Nodes.</description>

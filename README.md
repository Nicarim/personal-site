# Hugo based personal site

This site is used for <https://flicksfix.com> site of mine. Kind of portfolio or something.

No further instructions because it's my own site, unless I'll add some scripts here for the future.

## How to use
Install `hugo` globally, use `hugo server -D` to preview, and `hugo` to compile.
Deploy using `./deploy.sh`

<p>If you wish to contact me casually, reach out through email <a href="mailto:blog@flicksfix.com">blog@flicksfix.com</a></p>
<h2 id="job-offers">Job offers</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a job offer for me based on the experience you read about here, please email me <a href="mailto:blog+jobs@flicksfix.com">blog+jobs@flicksfix.com</a></p>
<p>Please include such details as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the work remote / onsite (I&rsquo;m based in Warsaw/Poland)</li>
<li>Compensation range
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t want to disclose that in the initial email, at least make sure it can be discussed on the first call.
Saves time for both parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What kind of company is that (VC Funded / Bootstrapped) and what sector</li>
<li>How big the company is</li>
<li>How your current stack looks like</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-job-interests-me">What kind of job interests me?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I really enjoy working as an <strong>SRE/DevOps</strong> where there is a place for such a person to advice on application architecture
<ul>
<li>I consider myself fully autonomous in that role - I can make sound decisions in the best interest of company</li>
<li>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not a team player - If there are other people in same role I&rsquo;ll happily cooperate</li>
<li>I also try to consider the cost of the solutions (especially in cloud providers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also like to work as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, however I much rather enjoy working on interesting challenges / problems in that role.
<ul>
<li>For example if SWE role is all about writing CRUD endpoints for different database entities because its some kind of
business application - I&rsquo;d pass on that offer</li>
<li>However, if you&rsquo;re working on a startup that works in rather interesting technical fields (for example k8s automation)
I&rsquo;ll happily consider SWE role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else you think my knowledge / experience would fit. I don&rsquo;t limit myself to a single role,
and I&rsquo;m always open to talk about it.</li>
</ul>
